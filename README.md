# R-Learning-Journey

This repository contains my practice scripts and exercises while learning R programming.  
I am building my skills step by step, using analogies from microbiology and lab science to make concepts clear.  

## Contents
- **copilot_R.R** – examples of numeric and character data types, arithmetic, and string manipulation  
- **akbarkanji_R.R** – additional practice scripts and exercises  

## Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of R basics  
- Document my learning journey for reproducibility  
- Build confidence in programming through patient, incremental practice
